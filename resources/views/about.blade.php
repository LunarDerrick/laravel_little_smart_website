                Established in 2018, Little Smart Day Care Centre provides after-school care for children until their parents return from work.
                With the opening of SJK(C) Bukit Serdang nearby the following year, the centre experienced a surge in enrolments.
                To meet parentsâ€™ requests, we expanded our services to include academic tuition, which has been a core part of our offerings ever since.

                As of 2024, Little Smart Day Care Centre caters to children aged 7 to 12, maintaining a consistent number of students each year.
                Our tuition program covers all academic subjects, with each day dedicated to focusing on one or two subjects.
                We aim to provide a supportive environment that enhances both the academic skills and confidence of our students.
