                Little Smart Day Care Centre was founded in 2018. As the name suggests, the centre mainly takes
                care of children after school until their parents come back from work. In the following year,
                SJK(C) Bukit Serdang was fully constructed and began their academic years in the nearby
                vicinity, the day care centre received a sudden influx of children. After some consideration, the
                director decided to offer academic tuition services as well due to some requests from the parents
                and had been operating in such mode ever since.
